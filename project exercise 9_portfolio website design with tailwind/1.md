**a. Define Reluctance and state its formula.**

* **Definition:** Reluctance is the opposition to the establishment of magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit. It's analogous to resistance in an electric circuit.
* **Formula:** R = (l / (μ * A))
    * Where:
        * R = Reluctance (Ampere-turns/Weber or A/Wb)
        * l = Length of the magnetic path (meters)
        * μ = Permeability of the material (Henry/meter)
        * A = Cross-sectional area of the magnetic path (square meters)

**b. Define Instantaneous value with waveform.**

* **Definition:** The instantaneous value of an alternating quantity (voltage or current) is the value of the quantity at any particular instant of time.
* **Waveform:** (Imagine a sine wave) The instantaneous value is represented by the vertical distance from the x-axis (zero point) to the curve at that specific time point.

**c. Define Frequency with waveform.**

* **Definition:** Frequency is the number of complete cycles of an alternating quantity (voltage or current) that occur per second. It's measured in Hertz (Hz).
* **Waveform:** (Imagine a sine wave) Frequency is determined by how many complete sine wave cycles occur within one second. A higher frequency means more cycles per second.

**d. Define Form factor with formula.**

* **Definition:** The form factor is the ratio of the RMS value (Root Mean Square) of an alternating quantity to its average value.
* **Formula:** Form Factor = (RMS Value) / (Average Value)
    * For a sine wave, the form factor is approximately 1.11.

| Line Current   | Line Current = Phase Current          | Line Current = √3 * Phase Current     |
| Power          | 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(φ)        | 3 * V_phase * I_phase * cos(φ)        |
| Application    | Used for power transmission          | Used for power distribution           |

**f. State the EMF equation of a transformer.**

E = 4.44 * f * N * Φ_m

Where:

* E = Induced EMF (Volts)
* f = Frequency of the supply (Hz)
* N = Number of turns in the winding
* Φ_m = Maximum flux in the core (Weber)

**g. Define the transformation ratio.**

The transformation ratio (K) of a transformer is the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary winding (N_s) to the number of turns in the primary winding (N_p).

K = N_s / N_p

It also equals the ratio of secondary voltage (E_s) to primary voltage (E_p)

K = E_s / E_p

**2. Explain Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction.**

Faraday's Law states that a changing magnetic field linked with a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil. The induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage.

**3. A metallic ring... H = ?**

* **Mean diameter (d):** 20 cm = 0.2 m
* **Radius (r):** d/2 = 0.1 m
* **Number of turns (N):** 1000
* **Current (I):** 1 A

**Formula:**  H = (N * I) / (2 * π * r)

H = (1000 * 1) / (2 * π * 0.1) 
H ≈ 1591.55 A/m (Ampere-turns per meter)

**4. Draw and label the constructional diagram of a DC machine.**

(Refer to a textbook or online resource for the diagram.  Key components to label include: Yoke, Pole Cores, Pole Shoes, Field Windings, Armature, Commutator, Brushes)

**5. A 2000/200 V, 1ph, 50 Hz transformer... turns on primary and secondary?**

* **V_primary (Vp):** 2000 V
* **V_secondary (Vs):** 200 V
* **Frequency (f):** 50 Hz
* **Maximum flux density (B_m):** 20 mWb = 0.02 Wb
* **Core area (A):** 1.1 cm² = 1.1 x 10^-4 m²

**Calculate Maximum Flux (Φ_m):**

Φ_m = B_m * A = 0.02 Wb * 1.1 x 10^-4 m² = 2.2 x 10^-6 Wb

**Use EMF Equation to find Turns:**

E = 4.44 * f * N * Φ_m

**Primary Turns (Np):**

2000 = 4.44 * 50 * Np * 2.2 x 10^-6 
Np ≈ 4054 turns

**Secondary Turns (Ns):**

200 = 4.44 * 50 * Ns * 2.2 x 10^-6
Ns ≈ 405 turns

**6. List the main parts of a DC motor and give the function of any two parts.**

* **Stator:** Stationary part, includes the yoke, poles, and field windings.
* **Rotor (Armature):** Rotating part, includes the armature windings, commutator, and shaft.
* **Commutator:** Rectifies the AC induced in the armature to DC for the external circuit.
* **Brushes:** Conduct current to and from the commutator.

**Functions of two parts:**

* **Stator:** Provides the stationary magnetic field necessary for the motor's operation.
* **Rotor:** Carries the current-carrying conductors that interact with the magnetic field to produce torque, causing rotation.

**7. State the working of a universal motor with a neat sketch.**

* **Working:** A universal motor works on both AC and DC supply. It's essentially a series-wound DC motor. When AC supply is given, the current through the field winding and armature reverses simultaneously, so the torque direction remains the same.
* **Sketch:** (Refer to a textbook or online resource for the diagram. Show a simple DC series motor diagram. Label the field windings connected in series with the armature, the supply (AC or DC), and the output shaft.)
