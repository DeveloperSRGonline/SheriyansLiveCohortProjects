1. **Define Relative Permeability.**
   - Relative permeability (μr) is the ratio of the permeability of a medium to the permeability of free space (μ0). It indicates how much more easily a magnetic field can be established in a material compared to a vacuum.  μr = μ / μ0

2. **Define Faraday's Law of Electromagnetism.**
   - Faraday's Law states that a changing magnetic field linked with a coil induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil. The induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage.

3. **Define Magnetic Flux Density.**
   - Magnetic flux density (B) is the amount of magnetic flux passing through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of the flux. It's measured in Tesla (T) or Weber per square meter (Wb/m²).

4. **Define Frequency and its Formula.**
   - Frequency (f) is the number of complete cycles of an alternating quantity (voltage or current) that occur per second. It's measured in Hertz (Hz).
   - Formula: f = 1 / T (where T is the time period of one cycle).

5. **Define RMS Value.**
   - The Root Mean Square (RMS) value of an alternating quantity is the effective value of the quantity. It's the equivalent DC value that would produce the same amount of heat in a resistor as the AC quantity.

6. **Draw a 3-phase Voltage Waveform of AC Supply.**
   - (Insert diagram here - three sine waves, 120 degrees apart)

7. **State the EMF Equation of a Transformer.**
   - E = 4.44 * f * N * Φm
     - Where: E = Induced EMF, f = Frequency, N = Number of turns, Φm = Maximum flux.

8. **Define Absolute Permeability.**
   - Absolute permeability (μ) is the measure of a material's ability to allow the formation of a magnetic field within it.  μ = μ0 * μr

9. **Define Magnetomotive Force (MMF).**
   - Magnetomotive force (MMF) is the force that establishes magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit. It's analogous to electromotive force (EMF) in an electric circuit. MMF = N * I (where N is the number of turns and I is the current).

10. **Define Reluctance.**
   - Reluctance is the opposition to the establishment of magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit.

11. **Define Form Factor.**
   - The form factor is the ratio of the RMS value of an alternating quantity to its average value.

2. **Explain Self-Induced EMF and Mutually Induced EMF.**

* **Self-Induced EMF:**
    - When the current in a coil changes, the magnetic flux linked with the *same* coil also changes.
    - According to Faraday's law, this change in flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil itself.
    - This induced EMF opposes the change in current that produced it (Lenz's Law).
    - The magnitude of the self-induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of current and the inductance (L) of the coil.  E = -L (di/dt)
    - This phenomenon is the basis for the operation of inductors.

* **Mutually Induced EMF:**
    - When a changing magnetic field produced by one coil (the primary coil) links with another nearby coil (the secondary coil), it induces an EMF in the *second* coil.
    - This happens because the changing magnetic flux associated with the primary coil also passes through the secondary coil, causing a change in flux linkage for the secondary coil.
    - The magnitude of the mutually induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of current in the primary coil and the mutual inductance (M) between the two coils. E₂ = -M (di₁/dt) (where E₂ is the EMF induced in the second coil, and i₁ is the current in the first coil).
    - This principle underlies the operation of transformers.

3. **For a Transformer, Give Any Two Ratios.**

* **Turns Ratio:** The turns ratio (N) is the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary winding (Nₛ) to the number of turns in the primary winding (Nₚ).
    - N = Nₛ / Nₚ
    - This ratio determines the voltage transformation.  If N > 1, the transformer is a step-up transformer (Vₛ > Vₚ). If N < 1, it's a step-down transformer (Vₛ < Vₚ).

* **Voltage Ratio:** The voltage ratio is the ratio of the secondary voltage (Vₛ) to the primary voltage (Vₚ).
    - Ideally (ignoring losses), the voltage ratio is equal to the turns ratio: Vₛ / Vₚ ≈ Nₛ / Nₚ
    - In a real transformer, there are small voltage drops due to winding resistance and leakage flux, so the voltage ratio is approximately equal to the turns ratio.

* **Current Ratio:** The current ratio is the ratio of the primary current (Iₚ) to the secondary current (Iₛ).
    - Ideally (ignoring losses), the current ratio is the inverse of the turns ratio: Iₚ / Iₛ ≈ Nₛ / Nₚ
    - This means that in a step-up transformer (N > 1), the voltage increases, and the current decreases. In a step-down transformer (N < 1), the voltage decreases, and the current increases.

4. **State Four Advantages of a Polyphase Circuit over a Single-Phase Circuit.**

* **Higher Power Output:** For the same physical size of equipment (generators, transformers, motors), a polyphase system (especially three-phase) can deliver significantly more power than a single-phase system.
* **Smoother and More Constant Torque:** In polyphase motors, the torque produced is more uniform and constant compared to the pulsating torque in single-phase motors. This leads to smoother operation and less vibration.
* **Reduced Voltage Drop:** For the same amount of power transmitted, polyphase systems require smaller conductors compared to single-phase systems. This results in a lower voltage drop in the transmission lines, improving efficiency.
* **Greater Efficiency in Power Transmission:** Due to the reduced voltage drop and the ability to use smaller conductors, polyphase systems are more efficient for transmitting power over long distances. This translates to lower transmission losses.
* **Ability to produce a rotating magnetic field:** Three-phase supplies can produce a rotating magnetic field, which is essential for the operation of three-phase induction motors, which are widely used in industries.

5. **Comparison of AC and DC.** (Refer to the table in the previous response)

6. **Draw and Label the Construction of a DC Motor.** (Refer to the diagram in the previous response)

7. **Explain Series Magnetic Circuit and Parallel Magnetic Circuit.**

* **Series Magnetic Circuit:**
    - In a series magnetic circuit, the magnetic flux (Φ) follows a *single* path through different parts of the circuit.
    - These parts may consist of different ferromagnetic materials with varying permeabilities or air gaps.
    - The total reluctance of the circuit is the sum of the individual reluctances of each part: Rₘ_total = Rₘ₁ + Rₘ₂ + Rₘ₃ + ...
    - Examples: A simple magnetic core with an air gap, a magnetic circuit with different materials in series.

* **Parallel Magnetic Circuit:**
    - In a parallel magnetic circuit, the magnetic flux (Φ) divides and follows *multiple* paths through different parts of the circuit.
    - The total reluctance of the circuit is calculated in a similar way to how resistances combine in a parallel electrical circuit: 1/Rₘ_total = 1/Rₘ₁ + 1/Rₘ₂ + 1/Rₘ₃ + ...
    - The flux divides between the parallel paths in inverse proportion to their reluctances. The path with the lower reluctance carries more flux.
    - Examples: A magnetic core with multiple parallel branches, a magnetic circuit with air gaps in parallel.
